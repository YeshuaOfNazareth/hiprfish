Removing output files of failed job generate_full_probes since they might be corrupted:
/home/miri/Desktop/HIPRFISH/data/simulation/SP1/SP1_full_length_probes_sequences.txt, /home/miri/Desktop/HIPRFISH/data/simulation/SP1/SP1_full_length_blocking_probes_sequences.txt, /home/miri/Desktop/HIPRFISH/data/simulation/SP1/SP1_full_length_helper_probes_sequences.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
